(318, "b'Content Creator'", "OPEN", "b'We are looking for content writer to help us tell amazing stories about how to use data in the real world with Graphext. Madrid and/or full Remote (Europe Timezone)What is this role all about?We believe that the best marketing is a great product that is so good, that people need to tell everyone about it when they try it for the first time:  word of mouth . \n  During many years, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t hired a single person for a marketing role because we wanted to  focus on making the product great . We recently launched a freemium version of Graphext so anyone can register and  try the product independently . We are starting to  feel comfortable reaching way more people  from those that organically met us (around 100 people a day visit our website organically) by word of mouth and reading our content in social media, primarily in Spanish for now. This also made 80% of the people visiting our website come from Spain (where we are originally from). It\'s time to  make the world know  what we are doing (in English). \n  We also believe the second-best way of  doing marketing is education . Buyers now prefer to self-educate. 3 of 4 business software buyers would rather self-educate than learn about a product from a salesperson. Our potential customers are curious and creative minds. They love learning about new things. So that\'s why we want to bet on  high-quality content  in  multiple forms : \n  This diagram represents the multiple platforms where we are currently posting content to  drive traffic  to sign up for Graphext, try the product, and eventually  pay for a pro account  if they are happy with the solution. \n  These are some of the principles we want to follow: \n \n-   Quality over Quantity . The internet is already full of content. We compete for attention with pages like  Towardsdatascience  ,  but especially against Youtubers, Netflix, and even WhatsApp memes,  if the content is bad, nobody will read it, and our brand will be irrelevant . \n-   Be succinct . Every single word counts. We can totally write long pieces (like this job offer) but every paragraph has to say something relevant. Twitter threads are a good way to encapsulate as much meaning as possible. \n-   Images  and  Videos  over  text . The ratio images vs text should be high (not like this job offer) \n-  Use the  language  and  style  of  every platform . The same way you speak differently to your parents than to your friends, Twitter and LinkedIn have different audiences, their language and technicality should change. \n \n  This  Pricenomics  content marketing handbook is gold. \n  We don\'t expect you to create all this content alone. You will create content, but a big part of your mission is to encourage our team to participate in creating this content, and you will  find external collaborators:  users that already use the product, customers, influencers, journalists... and you can also count on the design team to help you elaborating this content. \n  We really admire the way  Notion ,  Figma , or  Webflow  are  building communities  of  enthusiastic   users  around their products. We would like to become the data analytics tool in this new generation of SaaS tools.What we are expecting from youData Science SkillsGenuine Curiosity for data analytics -  We expect you to be very motivated about the possibilities data is bringing to the world, even if you have all the other skills we are listing below, if you are not passionate about this, we won\'t succeed. \n   Data Science Knowledge -  You will need to understand a lot of concepts in this field. If you have already studied or learned on your own about data analytics and can even program in Python or R, that\'s fantastic; otherwise, if you have the motivation, you learn them with us.Networking SkillsKnowledge of Existing Data Media  - You will be in charge of distributing our content, teach Graphext, reach out to influencers or reporters. If you already  know  key  opinion leaders  in this field and  publications  in this area, that\'s another extra point.Communication SkillsEnglish  - As mentioned before, one of our main objectives is to reach an international audience; we expect you to have fluid English if you speak Spanish even better, but for this role, English is more important. \n   Creativity to generate ideas for content -  Even though we have tons of ideas about what to publish, there are probably many other ideas way better we are missing. It will also be your responsibility to prioritize these ideas. \n   Writing Skills  - Clear writing means clear thinking. \n   Audiovisual Skills  - We want to bet a lot for audiovisual content ( YouTube videos , streaming on  Twitch , maybe podcasts..) I love these Webflow video tutorials for instance.Extra points if you...-  You have experience with  SEO  and  SEM . \n-  You have experience with  BI tools  like Tableau, and Power BI... \n-  Knowledge about no-code tools such asNotion, Webflow, Airtable, Zapier, Integromat...-  You have experience using  CRMs  like  Hubspot . \n-  You have a bachelor\'s degree or master\'s or any other educational background that proves you are hard-working, patient, and smart enough! (You can also be all these things without one, but it might save some time for us to test it) \n-  Previous experience in start-up environments.About your teammatesYou will mainly work with  Victoriano , CEO, and co-founder, who is also the person that currently does most of these tasks in Graphext. He is excited to finally hire someone to take this to the next level. \n  You will also be very close to the business team, led by Andr\xc3\xa9s and the our data scientists (Alex) \n  We are now around 20 people in the team that you will also meet and interact with, most of them developers.Sobre   GraphextSomos un equipo de  20 personas  con oficina en pleno  centro de   Madrid (Calle Arlab\xc3\xa1n 7) . Nos dedicamos a hacer un  producto de   software  para que la gente que ha estudiado ADE, Econ\xc3\xb3micas, Biolog\xc3\xada, Caminos o Periodismo... puedan hacer  an\xc3\xa1lisis avanzado de datos.  Para aquellos a los que Excel y los dashboards se les quedan cortos y tal. \n  Con Graphext intentamos que esos analistas, consigan hacer cosas m\xc3\xa1s \"predictivas\" y \xe2\x80\x9cpreescriptivas\xe2\x80\x9d para sacar conclusiones de los datos  como si hubieran estudiado Matem\xc3\xa1ticas , F\xc3\xadsica o Inform\xc3\xa1tica  y supieran escribir c\xc3\xb3digo en Python o R ... para m\xc3\xa1s de 50 casos de uso que vamos encontrando. Desde desarrollar f\xc3\xa1rmacos nuevos, a entender  por qu\xc3\xa9 se producen ciertos cr\xc3\xadmenes  o  por qu\xc3\xa9 se van los empleados  de una empresa. \n  Creemos que las herramientas que hay ahora mismo en el mercado limitan o impiden que muchos de estos analistas las pueda usar porque:  necesitas saber programar ,  no te gu\xc3\xadan pr\xc3\xa1cticamente nada  para descubrir qu\xc3\xa9 funciones de limpieza de datos, enriquecimiento o algoritmia puedes usar para resolver determinados problemas de negocio, son muy  poco interactivas y lentas  (human in the loop), y s\xc3\xb3lo te dejan trabajar con datos estructurados (num\xc3\xa9ricos y categ\xc3\xb3ricos) y se olvidan de todo lo que hoy d\xc3\xada conmachine learningse puede sacar de  inform\xc3\xa1ci\xc3\xb3n desesctructurada  (textos e im\xc3\xa1genes).C\xc3\xb3mo es el productoEn  nuestro canal de Youtube   encontrar\xc3\xa1s v\xc3\xaddeos  m\xc3\xa1s expl\xc3\xadcitos:  como este ejemplo  o  este otro  de tipos de an\xc3\xa1lisis que se pueden hacer. \n  En  nuestro Twitter  y  blog  tambi\xc3\xa9n solemos poner m\xc3\xa1s ejemplos regularmente de an\xc3\xa1lisis que vamos haciendo.\xc2\xbfPor qu\xc3\xa9 hac\xc3\xa9is este producto?Es una larga historia que  puedes escuchar un podcast de 45 minutos  donde nuestros inversores nos entrevistan.\xc2\xbfEs una empresa seria?Victoriano y Miguel, empezaron a trabajar juntos en otra aplicaci\xc3\xb3n de an\xc3\xa1lisis de datos ya en 2014, pero no fue hasta 2017 que la idea de Graphext tom\xc3\xb3 forma. Recientemente hemos levantado una ronda de $4.7M (en total hemos levantado m\xc3\xa1s de $7M durante estos a\xc3\xb1os) de inversores internacionales y de muchos de los mejores business angels t\xc3\xa9cnicos de Espa\xc3\xb1a. \n  Adem\xc3\xa1s de la inversi\xc3\xb3n recibida para crear el producto de la nada, vamos a\xc3\xb1adiendo clientes nuevos mes a mes.D\xc3\xb3nde y cu\xc3\xa1ndoNuestras oficinas est\xc3\xa1n en  pleno centro de Madrid , en la Calle Arlab\xc3\xa1n 7 concretamente. Puedes ver fotos en nuestro  Instagram.  \n  Actualmente todo el equipo, dada la situaci\xc3\xb3n, est\xc3\xa1 trabajando plenamente en remoto. \n  En la vieja o nueva normalidad  somos muy flexibles  con  c\xc3\xb3mo repartes tus horas de trabajo . Pensamos que vernos en persona a menudo tiene mucho valor. No todos los d\xc3\xadas, pero s\xc3\xad a menudo. Por eso  puedes quedarte a trabajar en casa varios d\xc3\xadas a la semana sin problema , pero esperamos verte por la oficina tambi\xc3\xa9n durante la semana. Somos un equipo peque\xc3\xb1o y las relaciones de confianza que se generan o la capacidad de pensar en cosas creativas fuera del roadmap, de momento, pensamos que funcionan mejor en persona que a trav\xc3\xa9s de una videollamada. \n  Lo mismo con tus  d\xc3\xadas de vacaciones . Puedes repartirlos a lo largo del a\xc3\xb1o con toda la flexibilidad, coordinandote un poco antes con tus compa\xc3\xb1eros.Con qu\xc3\xa9 valores-  Tenemos una cultura basada en la  responsabilidad,  somos pocos y no queremos tener m\xc3\xa1s capitanes que marineros, as\xc3\xad que contratamos gente de la que esperamos poder confiar sin tener que estar supervisando constantemente, con una  motivaci\xc3\xb3n instr\xc3\xadnsica por seguir creciendo profesionalmente . \n-  Nos gusta la  honestidad  y  transparencia . Creemos que casi todos los problemas gordos empiezan como maletendidos peque\xc3\xb1os que suelen tener que ver con cierta falta de  confianza  que nace de no tener informaci\xc3\xb3n suficiente. \n-  Procuramos crear un ambiente donde la gente pueda hablar libremente,  ser aut\xc3\xa9ntica y emp\xc3\xa1tica al mismo tiempo  con todos los compa\xc3\xb1eros del equipo. \n-  Tratamos de tener  las m\xc3\xadnimas reuniones posibles . \n-  Aunque somos una startup, entendemos que para ganar de verdad, esta  va a ser una carrera larga  y cuidamos de que nadie se queme. Si un d\xc3\xada echas m\xc3\xa1s horas de lo normal porque ten\xc3\xadasflow(estabas inspirado) y quer\xc3\xadas acabar algo o hab\xc3\xada un fuego que apagar, trabajar\xc3\xa1s menos horas al d\xc3\xada siguiente. No te vamos a tener d\xc3\xadas o semanas esprintando. \n-  Esperemos que  entiendas y hables ingl\xc3\xa9s . No tiene que ser perfecto, pero s\xc3\xad suficiente para poder comunicarte. Por tu posici\xc3\xb3n en el equipo, de momento, te relacionaras casi siempre con gente que hable espa\xc3\xb1ol, pero somos una empresa con  mentalidad   global . Casi todas las comunicaciones externas e internas de la empresa se hacen en ingl\xc3\xa9s, porque hacemos un producto para cualquier persona del mundo. Adem\xc3\xa1s tenemos miembros en el equipo que son extranjeros, que no necesariamente necesitan saber hablar espa\xc3\xb1ol, y esperamos que con los a\xc3\xb1os sigamos sumando extranjeros al equipo.Why do we do Graphext?We develop software for people who studied business, economics, biology, psychology, engineering, or journalism... and that now call themselves data scientists. Graphext enables them to do  advanced data analytics   without knowing how to write code  for those creative people that find Excel and current business intelligence tools (like Tableau or Power BI) too limited. \n  We allow them to run analyses that are more \"predictive\"and \"prescriptive\"thandescriptive, with the same power of analysis  as if they had studied Maths  or Computer Science and knew how to write code in Python or R... for more than 50 different use cases that we have identified so far... from developing new drugs, to understand  why some crimes are growing  o why the  employees of a company are leaving . \n  Current data science tools demand learning to  code  in Python or R (which takes years until someone is fluid enough). These tools  don\'t guide  you either. Don\'t help you discover what methods and techniques are appropriate for different kinds of analysis (data cleaning, enrichment, modeling) to solve many business problems. These tools aren\'t very  interactive  (you need a quick feedback loop to understand what you are doing), and you can only work with structured data (numerical and categorical data). They miss all the possibilities we now have to analyze  texts  and  images  thanks to AI\'s latest advancements. \n  We highly value candidates who register for a free account and try Graphext before the first interview, and come with questions.What does the product look like?On our  Youtube channel , you will find more detailed videos. \n  We also regularly post more examples on our  Twitter  and  Blog .How is this company doing?The two co-founders,  Victoriano  and  Miguel , spent the first years building  another product  that inspired them to later, in 2017 start Graphext. Recently, we raised a $4.7M round (we have raised more than $7M during these years) from international investors and many of Spain\'s top technical business angels. \n  At the same time, we also keep growing our revenue as we sign more and more customers every month.Where, when, and how-  We do have a very nice office in central Madrid, plenty of light, two terraces, and a BBQ :) If you happen to live in Madrid, you can come anytime. We are a global remote company by default, and we usually bring to Madrid all the people working remotely once a quarter for an entire week. \n-  We are really flexible about how you administrate your time. \n-  Really flexible about your vacations too. Just coordination with the rest of the team is required. \n-  You will choose the machine which you would like to work on. Most of us are using Macbook Pro or MacBook Air. You will decide if you prefer Windows rather than macOS.Our core values-  Our culture is based on  responsibility . We are still a small company, and we don\'t want to have more managers and individual contributors, so we focus on hiring people we expect to trust without supervising all the time, with a high intrinsic motivation to keep growing as a professional. \n-  We like  honesty  and  transparency . We believe most big issues arise as small misunderstandings and lack of communication erode trust for not having enough information to understand decisions. \n-  We really do our best to create an environment where people can  speak freely , being  authentic  and  empathic  at the same time with all their peers. \n-  We try to have as  few meetings  as possible. \n-  Even though we are a startup, we  play a long game,  and we care to avoid burnout. If you want or need to work many hours one day because you had flow, you were inspired, or there was an emergency, you will work less the following day. You are not gonna be sprinting for weeks. \n-  We have a  global mindset . Even though most team members are Spanish, we are open to hiring anybody from anywhere. We make sure people are comfortable communicating in English. Everything is documented and reported in English.'", "OnSite", 1, "Madrid, Madrid provincia"),
